[Intro]
(But I wanna stay)

[Verse 1]
I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you (Alright)
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby

[Refrain]
Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I

[Chorus]
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

[Verse 2]
I want you to see, hm
How you look to me, hm
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya
But you're so full of shit, uh
Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye

[Chorus]
Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better

[Post-Chorus]
I knew you in another life
You had that same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised

[Verse 1]
Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never-endin', we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Please, stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind

[Chorus]
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me

[Verse 2]
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all, the more that we will fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Please, don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay

[Chorus]
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me

[Bridge]
We're not the only ones, I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said, you know I'll always mean
It is the world to me that you are in my life
But I want to live and not just survive

[Chorus]
That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me

[Intro: Aran]
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

[Verse 1: Aran, All]
불꺼진 romantic all my life
내 주위는 온통 lovely day
내 눈 속에 비친 arrow sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
그만 힐끗대고 말해줘요 hold me (Hold me)
다시 crying in my room
숨기고 싶어 (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb

[Verse 2: Aran, Aran & Keena]
또 꿈길을 걷는 every day
눈 뜨면 다시 또 flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
나 솔직히 지금이 편해
상상만큼 짜릿한 걸까?

Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
매일 꿈속에서 연습했죠 kiss me (Kiss me)
다시 crying in my room
포기할까봐 (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb

[Verse 3: Keena, Saena, Both]
I'm so lonely, hold me tightly
짜릿한 걸 원해 who will really love me truly
내게 기다림은 없어 I can't wait
더는 믿지 않아 now I'm gonna make it mine
Love is a light, I'ma show my love is right
It's not a joke, so give it to me right now
No more chance to you
You know, hey, d-d-d-dumb boy

[Bridge: Aran, Sio]
꿈속에 매일 밤
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

[Chorus: All, Aran, Sio]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid (Hopeless girl is seeking)
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid (Someone who will share this feeling)
다시 한번 못 들은 척 기회를 줄게 (I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb (A fool for love, a fool for love)

[Intro: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy-ever-afters did exist
I would still be holdin' you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine (Oh)
I don't expect you to care (Yeah)
I know I said it before, but
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed (Oh)
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Wiz Khalifa]
I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Oh, oh)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)
If happy-ever-afters did exist
I would still be holdin' you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick (Uh)
Now I'm at a payphone

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Man, fuck that shit
I be out spendin' all this money while you sittin' 'round
Wonderin' why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Tellin' me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you coulda saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Woo)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong (Yeah)
Where are the plans we made for two? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
If happy-ever-after's did exist (Oh, then)
I would still be holdin' you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit (Yeah)
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick
Yeah, now I'm at a payphone

[Verse 1]
Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars
I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
You'd be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?
Know you're all that I want this life

[Chorus]
I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

[Verse 2]
My love will always stay by you
I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing
I'll tell you I love you more
It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you

[Chorus]
I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?
